Snap Tap Usage Policy
We recommend using Snap Tap only for single-player games. In games with multiplayer functionality, this technology can alter competitive dynamics and is often interpreted by anti-cheat systems as a form of cheating. To avoid compliance issues or penalties, please refrain from using it in those scenarios.

# ⚡ **Eliminating Input Lag**

**Input lag** can be the difference between an epic win and a frustrating loss.

### ✅ **USB Port (Important):**
> Plug your keyboard directly into a **rear USB port** on your motherboard.  
Avoid USB hubs, extenders, or front panel ports — they **introduce latency**.

---

# 🧠 **Anti-Ghosting Technology and Simultaneous Keystrokes**

**Anti-Ghosting** allows multiple key presses at once **without losing commands** — essential for competitive games.

> On regular keyboards, pressing multiple keys can cause **ghosting** (ignored inputs).  
Gaming keyboards with **native Anti-Ghosting support** prevent this issue.

But even with advanced hardware, some **system settings** can further enhance performance.
