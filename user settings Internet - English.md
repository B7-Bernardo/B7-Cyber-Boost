## 🔍 Check Your Connection Speed

**Optimize your performance by identifying the real capacity of your network adapter:**

### ✅ How to check:

1. Open the **Windows Control Panel**.
2. Go to **Network and Sharing Center** > **Change adapter settings**.
3. Right-click on **Ethernet** and select **Status**.
4. Check the **Speed** line:

| Result     | Interpretation                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `100 Mbps` | Fast Ethernet adapter (limited to 100 Mbps) |
| `1.0 Gbps` | Gigabit adapter (uses your full bandwidth)  |
